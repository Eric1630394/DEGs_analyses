# Bacterial-Genomics🧬💻
In this repository you will find some scripts that I created💡 to solve specific parts of diverse exercices in the context of the subject "Bacterial Genomics🔬".

All the code is hard-written in R. It uses a well-known package⚙️, that is ggplot2. Example data (those used in the exercises) is available in the repository.
#📁 DEG_analysis
This folder contains 3 folders with the files used to adress 3 different parts of an exercise about RNA-seq data.

📁 FPKMs_plotting: files used to plot FPKMs' boxplot and dispersion diagram.
📁 Volcano_plot: files used to elaboarate a volcano plot of DEGs.
