# Bacterial-Genomics🧬💻
In this repository you will find some scripts that I created💡 to solve specific parts of diverse exercices in the context of the subject "Bacterial Genomics🔬".

All the code is hard-written in R. It uses a well-known package⚙️, that is ggplot2. Example data (those used in the exercises) is available in the repository.
