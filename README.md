# Bacterial-Genomics🧬💻
In this repository you will find some scripts that I created💡 to solve specific parts of diverse exercices in the context of the subject "Bacterial Genomics🔬".

All the code is hard-written in R. It uses a well-known package⚙️, that is ggplot2. Example data (those used in the exercises) is available in the repository.

This repository contains 2 folders with the files used to adress 2 different parts of an exercise about RNA-seq data.

- 📁 `FPKMs_plotting`: files used to plot FPKMs' boxplot and dispersion diagram.
- 📁 `Volcano_plot`: files used to elaboarate a volcano plot of DEGs.
